### Main Applied Concepts

1. **Charting Libraries:**  
   - Use of Recharts and react-chartjs-2 to animate and craft interactive graphical visualizations.  
   - Different chart types employed:  
     - Line for monthly sales trends.  
     - Pie for product category distributions (not fully shown).  
     - Bar for customer acquisition.  
     - Area for weekly visitor trends (implied).  

2. **Responsive Design:**  
   - Used ResponsiveContainer from Recharts and maintainAspectRatio in ChartJS to allow for screens of different sizes.  

3. **Data Transformation:**  
   - Data wrangling from raw data (e.g., date formatting with date-fns) to facilitate visualization.  
   - Dynamic data loading with useState and useEffect hooks of React.  

4. **Interactivity:**  
   - Tooltips with custom formatting (currency).  
   - Legends and reference lines for better identification.  

5. **Performance Optimization:**  
   - Avoiding re-renders by memoizing chart data wherever possible.

### What I Learned

- **Library Integration:** I had hands-on experience integrating multiple charting libraries into a React application, namely Recharts and ChartJS.  
- **Data Handling:** Transformation and mapping of raw data to formats usable by charting libraries were learned.
